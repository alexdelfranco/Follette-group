It includes several wrapper functions, which all ihnerit from the same object, and performing different tasks like matched filters, SNR map calculation, detection of high SNR blobs and others. A lot features have been automated and are therefore hidden from the user, which is appreciable when running the same sequence of tasks and many datasets.

Therefore, an iPython notebook is not an optimal mean to run this code. One should consider running a script with the linux command *nice* to let it run in the background. The ideal environment for this FMMF implementation is a supercluster where several dataset can be ran in parallel."
